    <h1>R.A.W. Talent Art Review</h1>
    <h2>Avoid this scammer!</h2>
    <p class="date">Published on September 6, 2023</p>

    <p>On September 13, 2002, I made a purchase on Etsy from user <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/RAWTALENTART" target="_blank">RAWTALENTART</a> ("R.A.W. Talent Art"). Although I was not directly referred to them, I recognized their work from a popular YouTuber who collects retro games and consoles. This seller had plenty of feedback and several public, scot-free social media profiles, so I believed they could be trusted.</p>

    <p>I decided to purchase the following item: <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1259618752/custom-nintendo-gamecube-console-led">https://www.etsy.com/listing/1259618752/custom-nintendo-gamecube-console-led</a></p>

    <p>Here is a screenshot of that purchase:</p>
    <img src="etsy-purchase.png" alt="Etsy purchase screenshot">

    <p>I understand that most of these custom consoles are made to order, and I'm rarely in a rush to get anything, so I wasn't suspicious after months of not receiving my console. After two months, I even began to ask about purchasing another console. Fortunately, I never followed up with them about this.</p>

    <h2>Timeline of Promises</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
        <li>September 14, 2022: Getting to work on it "ASAP"</li>
        <li>November 28, 2022: "Should be ready by the end of the week"</li>
        <li>February 27, 2023: Requests my personal information (which they already had), claims they are ready to ship</li>
        <li>March 11, 2023: "Ran into a few issues that needed correction," will "complete and ship next week"</li>
        <li>April 4, 2023: Completion "this week"</li>
        <li>May 14, 2023: "This week"</li>
        <li>May 23, 2023: "Shipping this week," refuses to refund</li>
        <li>May 26, 2023: Claims I will receive a refund, as well as a "sample of their work," neither of which are ever sent</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is a full screenshot of our Etsy communication up through that date:</p>
    <img src="etsy-messages.png" alt="Etsy messages screenshot">

    <p>Over the last few hours, I have been in communication with this seller. They are now claiming they will refund half of my money and send me the console. When given the information needed to refund me, they continue to stall and make more bizarre attempts at gaslighting me. They go on to claim that I am a "keyboard warrior" for attempting to recover over $300 that they have held from me, which will see its one-year anniversary in exactly a week from the day I'm publishing this.</p>

    <p>This seller clearly has many happy customers, and they are obviously capable of delivering well-made custom consoles, as their feedback and reputation suggests. I also fully understand that people go through tough times. However, it is extremely clear that this seller has no intention to do good on their word, and their desperation has now reaches inexcusable levels of irresponsibility and immaturity. They update their social media every week, they are constantly listing new items on their Etsy page, etc. I do not believe they are in the dire financial straits that they claim they are, and even if they are, I will no longer sympathize.</p>

    <p><strong>R.A.W. Talent Art stole $300 from me and refuses to refund or send me the console that I paid for. If you buy from them on Etsy or eBay, do not allow them to stall beyond your buyer protection window. They cannot be trusted to make good on their word, even after being given an entire year to do so. It's extremely clear that this seller cannot behave like an adult and handle their responsibilities.</strong></p>
